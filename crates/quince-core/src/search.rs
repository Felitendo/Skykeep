//! One search across everything the library holds — notes, reminders, events, contacts,
//! files and photos — offline and at once, as neither icloud.com nor a Mac offers: each app
//! searches only itself there.
//!
//! Words are looked up in one full-text index (migration 45, kept current by triggers in the
//! same transaction as every write), so a search reads only what holds its words rather than
//! reading and folding every row: every word has to begin a word of the record, in any order,
//! case and accents aside — as Spotlight and Apple's own apps find things. Within an app the
//! best come first: a title that begins with what was typed, then a title that holds it all,
//! then the rest; ties go to the most recent (a note edited lately, a reminder due soonest, an
//! event nearest now) and contacts to their place in the address book. Photos are searched as
//! Photos searches them, by the names of the dates they were taken too, which no index holds.
//!
//! What crosses into the window is small: per app a few hits, each a title and one line of
//! detail with where the typed words fall in them — never a note's text.
