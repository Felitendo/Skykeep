//! updated by its package manager and is never offered an update here ([`install_kind`]).
//!
//! Shortly after launch, and about once a day after that, the latest release's `latest.json`
//! is read through a client that can reach GitHub's release servers and nothing else
//! (`quince_auth::releases`). A newer version is offered in one window, never in several. It
//! is downloaded only when the person asks, verified against Skykeep's public key by the
//! updater plugin (a minisign signature with the version signed into it, so an older release
//! cannot be passed off as a newer one), and installed only once nothing is waiting to reach
//! iCloud and nobody is typing. Then Skykeep restarts into it.
//!
//! A check made on its own that fails (offline, GitHub busy) is never said. One asked for in
//! Settings is, plainly. A download that fails its signature is never installed, and says so.
