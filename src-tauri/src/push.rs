//! Apple's pushes, turned into refreshes of exactly what changed.
//!
//! A change made on a phone reaches this computer two ways:
//!
//! - **Live:** the web push socket icloud.com itself uses (`quince_icloud::courier`). Apple
//!   says within about a second that Notes, Reminders or Photos changed, and only that
//!   service is refreshed. A dropped socket is reconnected with backoff; a refusal (an
//!   endpoint Apple retired, a bad request) is tried again only after half an hour and
//!   more, never in a loop.
//! - **Polling, while there is no live channel:** each container's `changes/database` token —
//!   one small read-only request — is asked every few seconds while a window has focus, less
//!   often while one is merely open, and rarely from the tray; at once when the window gains
//!   focus or the network comes back ([`wake`]). Only a container whose token moved is
//!   refreshed.
//!
//! The log hears one line when the channel goes down and one when it is back. The timed
//! pass stays as the floor beneath both, for anything that went missing.
