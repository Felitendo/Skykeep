//! The move from identifiers the app had before (`PREVIOUS`) to the one it has now
//! (tauri.conf.json's `identifier`), once, at launch, before anything opens the library.
//!
//! The identifier names every folder the app keeps: the library and everything beside it
//! (`~/.local/share/<id>`, `%APPDATA%\<id>`), WebKitGTK's storage inside it (localStorage, its
//! caches), the window-state file (`~/.config/<id>`), the cache folder, and on Windows
//! WebView2's (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\<id>\EBWebView`). Changed without a move, an existing install
//! would open on an empty library, its unsent Drive files and signed-in session left behind.
//! The keyring entries move on their own, on first read (quince-auth `read_moving`).
//!
//! Crash safety. Each folder moves with one `rename` where it can: atomic, so a crash leaves it
//! either all old or all new. Where it cannot (another filesystem), it is copied into a staging
//! folder beside the new one, compared byte for byte, recorded as complete in a journal, and
//! only then put in place and the old one deleted. A journal left by a crash says which side
//! is whole: `copying` — the old one, and the staging copy is thrown away and redone; `copied` —
//! the copy, and the move is finished. Nothing is ever half in both places and read as whole.
//!
//! Never empty. If the move fails, this launch runs under the old identifier, from the old
//! folders as they were, and the next launch tries again. Both folders present (a build with
//! the new identifier ran before this one): a new folder with no library in it is set aside —
//! renamed, never deleted — and the old one moved in; if both hold a library, the larger one
//! is kept in place and the other set aside beside it.
