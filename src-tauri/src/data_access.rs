//! Advanced Data Protection approvals, followed for the window (see `quince_auth::pcs`).
//!
//! An account with Advanced Data Protection and "Access iCloud Data on the Web" on lets this
//! session read Notes, Reminders, Photos and iCloud Drive only once the person approves it on
//! one of their devices, for about an hour at a time, and every key Apple then releases shows a
//! notice on their devices. So this is never background work:
//!
//! * Apple is asked only when the person acts — signing in, or pressing Sync Now (the approval
//!   card's button, or an explicit refresh). Every protected service is asked for in that one
//!   go, back to back, so one approval covers them all.
//! * A background pass (the timer, a push, a window coming back) asks Apple nothing about it:
//!   it reads where things stand from what is held here ([`Client::data_access_standing`]), and
//!   the protected services wait — not fail — until the next approval. Calendar and Contacts,
//!   which Apple does not protect this way, carry on as usual.
//! * Keys are held only until they run out, by the time recorded when they arrived, so passes
//!   stop asking for a protected service before Apple would refuse it.
//! * While an approval is on its way the client is taken only for each step, so nothing waits
//!   behind it; once it is given, what was waiting is read and the changes queued meanwhile go.
